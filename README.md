## Description
This application had mainly for eductational purpose. It shows the IceCube detector as a hologram. It comes in various sizes (that can be chnaged by voice control) so that you can place you own IceCube instance on a --say-- table and look at how photons propagate in the ice when an neutrino interacts in the detector.  
Both real data and simulations are shown.
An example can be found seen here:
